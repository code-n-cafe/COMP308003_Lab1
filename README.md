# Changelog

## [09-02-2026]
- Changed the structure of the entire app to support the separation of front end and back end
- Added a few more constraint to the Schemas
- Added .gitattributes and .editorconfig to standardize different work env (i.e. Windows, MacOS)
- I attempted the mongoDB settings before Fatimah send the result, but not sure what to keep and what to get rid of. Therefore, I leave them there for reference for now (inside /server/config and /config)
